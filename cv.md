## Briefly About Myself ##

Since the beginning of my studying, I want to create useful and convinient products for users. Therefore, I am studying at BSUIR in a specialty involving the learning of UI and UX. I am also interested in psychological disciplines. They help me to improve the quality of my communication with people and to understand their desires.

I am interested in learning new information. I get real pleasure from communicating with people. I am able to accurately express my thoughts and argue my position. In communication, I show restraint, I don't raise my voice to the interlocutor, I try to understand the problem that has arisen and solve it.

      for (let i = 0; i < ticket.length; i++) {
        if(ticket[i][0].indexOf(String.fromCharCode(ticket[i][1])) !== -1) {
          miniWins++;
          if (miniWins >= win) return 'Winner!';
        }
