## Briefly About Myself ##

Since the beginning of my studying, I want to create useful and convinient products for users. Therefore, I am studying at BSUIR in a specialty involving the learning of UI and UX. I am also interested in psychological disciplines. They help me to improve the quality of my communication with people and to understand their desires.

I am interested in learning new information. I get real pleasure from communicating with people. I am able to accurately express my thoughts and argue my position. In communication, I show restraint, I don't raise my voice to the interlocutor, I try to understand the problem that has arisen and solve it.

## Code example ##

**Codewars:** Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days.

```
    int rental_car_cost(int days){
    if(days >= 7) 
        return 40 * days - 50;
    else if (days >= 3)
        return 40 * days - 20;
    else
        return 40 * days;
    }
```
